  We often find difficulty in finding the items we lose on campus through whatsapp group as there are innumerable lost and found messages and images where we lose track of most of the updates.In order to reduce the problem,we came up with the idea of creating lost and found website.Users reporting a lost item can simply click on the "LOST" button, fill out a form describing the item, and receive a  list of similar items for easy identification. User can claim it if he finds his item otherwise Unclaimed data is automatically deleted from the database after 24 hours.For users who find items, the "FOUND" section will be directed to another form asking for similar details and description and image of the item.This information will be stored in the database until the owner claims it.Our platform prioritizes efficiency through advanced matching algorithms and a straightforward process, offering a swift and effective solution for reuniting individuals with their belongings on campus.
